## Project

For this project the dataset [wine](https://github.com/ilipan15/wine_regression_analysis/blob/main/wine.txt) was used, which contains information on prices and growing characteristics of 25 Bordeaux wines from 1952 to 1998. The data frame contains 7 columns and 47 rows. The columns are: year of production year, average price of the wines as a percentage of the 1961 price (price), mm of rain in the harvest month (h.rain), average temperature (C) over the summer preceding harvest (s.temp), mm of rain in the winter preceding harvest (w.rain), average temperature (C) at har- vest (h.temp), a rating of the wine quality (parker).

The aim of the analysis is to model the response variable price as a function of the variables described above.
